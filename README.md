# Burger-Logger

## **Description**
Burger Logger is a application that displays my knowledge in MVC and various front and back-end techonogies and the ability to interact with a remote database using the CRUD method (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Work was done through Node.js with the use of npm packages such as Express, Handlebars, and MySQL.
<br> <br>
Through the use of Node and Express, I was able to connect the MySQL Gui, MySQL workbench, so I could have a running database.
<br> <br>
The main webpage is generated through the NPM package Handlebars. Once the user inputs their information (Or choice of burger in this case), it will then pass through the MySQL database for any database modifications. This application has been deployed through Heroku.
